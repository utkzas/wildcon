# wildcon
We created an app which records various wildlife harmful activities like illegal hunting & poaching & smuggling occuring in various parts of the country or even report animals in distress. 
People can upload evidences and report all information through a centralised database. 
Wildlife inspectors immediately get EMail once an incident is reported
They see centralised database and can review & take action immediately.

#Challenges we faced
We tried to use Twilio to send SMS to users but due to Twilio-integration issues, we coudn't make it. We used Zoho to send Emails to all users automatically.
Apart from that, we first tried making it with MongoDB and React but, it didnt integrate with the HTML Website, we had nodemon server issues
